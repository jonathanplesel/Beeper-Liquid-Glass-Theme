For those who can’t wait an official release, a small theme that makes me want to use Beeper even more. Based on the colors of Apple Messages and its new Liquid Glass UI. I took the liberty of removing the search button, the new message button, and the send message button.

1. Beeper > Settings > Appearence > Custom CSS > Show CSS file
2. Replace custom.css
3. Reload CSS.

Enjoy :)
